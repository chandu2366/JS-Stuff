        1) NATIVE OBJECT:  Native Objects are built in objects of Javascript.  These are accessible anywhere in the program.

        2) USER DEFINED OBJECT:  User-defined objects are defined by the user.
                Is it done only by  creating instance of an object using new ?.

        3) ENVIRONMENT OBJECT: This is also called Hosts Objects,  These are provided by Javascript by the browser or any other environment.
                ex for browser: window, document, forms etc
                Host objects can differ by environment (or host), so that Node wouldnâ€™t have access to window, but could have its own host objects like NodeLists
