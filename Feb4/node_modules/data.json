For example, providing consistent performance on our OLTP databases, and making sure the ETL processes will land data correctly and on-time in the data warehouse.Business analysts care a lot about other things - for example getting the newest data to their dashboards and being able to run crazy queries really fast without anyone killing the queries for silly reasons like \"performance\". They also want to be able to get all the data they need without having to integrate with gazillion data stores.Apache Kafka, a distributed queue developed at LinkedIn to solve the problem of integrating databases at large scale, offers a surprising solution to all these problems. Which probably explains why it gains popularity so fast.In this session, we will explain what is Apache Kafka and why it rapidly becomes the secret weapon in the fight to keep databases sane.</p> <p><br/><i>About Gwen Shapira</i></p> <p>Gwen is a system architect at Confluent helping customers achieve success with their Apache Kafka implementation. She has 15 years of experience working with code and customers to build scalable data architectures, integrating relational and big data technologies. She currently specializes in building real-time reliable data processing pipelines using Apache Kafka. Gwen is an Oracle Ace Director, an author of \"Hadoop Application Architectures\", and a frequent presenter at industry conferences.

He loves getting out into the National and State Parks and finding the darkest skies possible. He has found that night photography and astro-landscape photography have allowed me to create new and different images. During His talk, He will try to take you on a journey of the night sky and introduce you to astro-landscape photography.

For example, providing consistent performance on our OLTP databases, and making sure the ETL processes will land data correctly and on-time in the data warehouse.Business analysts care a lot about other things - for example getting the newest data to their dashboards and being able to run crazy queries really fast without anyone killing the queries for silly reasons like \"performance\". They also want to be able to get all the data they need without having to integrate with gazillion data stores.Apache Kafka, a distributed queue developed at LinkedIn to solve the problem of integrating databases at large scale, offers a surprising solution to all these problems. Which probably explains why it gains popularity so fast.In this session, we will explain what is Apache Kafka and why it rapidly becomes the secret weapon in the fight to keep databases sane.</p> <p>\n\n\n\nPostgreSQL and Linux Containers:</p> <p>In this session we will look into rise of Linux Containers in DevOps and a quick dive into the docker implementation including how to use volumes in docker containers. We will also talk about common pitfalls of using PostgreSQL in docker containers and how to avoid them.</p> <p>\n\n\nAbout Gwen Shapira:</p> <p>Gwen is a system architect at Confluent helping customers achieve success with their Apache Kafka implementation. She has 15 years of experience working with code and customers to build scalable data architectures, integrating relational and big data technologies. She currently specializes in building real-time reliable data processing pipelines using Apache Kafka. Gwen is an Oracle Ace Director, an author of \"Hadoop Application Architectures\", and a frequent presenter at industry conferences. Gwen is also a committer on the Apache Kafka and Apache Sqoop projects. When Gwen isn't coding or building data pipelines, you can find her pedaling on her bike exploring the roads and trails of California, and beyond.</p> <p>\n\n\n\nAbout Jignesh Shah:</p> <p>Jignesh works for AppOrbit.</p>","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/postgresql-1/events/225930759/","yes_rsvp_count":69,"name":"South Bay PostgreSQL Meetup","id":"225930759","time":1452049200000,"updated":1452063883000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1143240078000,"name":"The San Francisco Bay Area PostgreSQL Meetup Group","group_lon":-122.41999816894531,"id":230033,"urlname":"postgresql-1","group_lat":37.790000915527344,"who":"PostgreSQL Users and Developers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":-28800000,"venue":{"zip":"94063","country":"us","city":"Redwood City","phone":"650-679-8184","address_1":"863 Main Street","name":"ANGeLiCAS","lon":-122.225868,"id":14157742,"state":"CA","lat":37.485435,"repinned":false},"headcount":25,"distance":13.468122482299805,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1432428601000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Angelicas Theatre Two – Upstairs Dining Room</p> <p>Here is your chance to sing in public with a PA, in front of a live audience.

League director will give you an estimate rating if you don't have one.</p> <p><b><br/></b></p> <p><b>League Format</b></p> <p>The league director starts off each league with a printout of potential league players, in the order of player rating. The format is to put the top five players in the first group, the next five are put in the second group, and so on down the list. If the number of players in the league is not divisible by five, then the number of players in some groups would be adjusted. </p> <p>Players play all other members in their group. The goal is to win the group, and to improve one’s league rating. Recommended format is best of 3 to 11 - depending on number of players and time available.</p> <p><br/><b>League Ratings</b></p> <p>At the start of the league, players will start out with either <a href=\"http://www.usatt.org/ratings/ratingsprocess.html\">USATT ratings</a> or estimated ratings. League ratings will change in the same way that USATT ratings change, using the same rating chart. Ratings will be calculated online when results are input by the League Director. Unrated players will be given a rating of 800, if no better estimate is available.

Be open to feedback. <br/>Newbies: Know that your team, especially your beater or chaser partners, might shout instructions at you. Quidditch relies on communication. If you feel they are being rude or could communicate better, talk to them during water break and let them know for next time.</p> <p>4. No conflicts on the pitch! <br/>If there is an issue you can't solve on the pitch in a friendly way, talk to one of our captains (Matthew, Dalia, or Janos) and they will take care of the issue.

Since we’re accustom to 3D learning we draw the conclusion reading a book will give us spiritual knowledge.  This is not the case, multidimensional understanding cannot be expressed in 3D words any more than a beautiful sunset can be described using only one letter of the alphabet.</p> <p>Many years of meditation usually covering decades is a time honored way to gain spiritual knowledge and this is the way it’s been for centuries.  What those seeking enlightenment are after is not “thinking” we know but “knowing” we have an understanding.  There is a big difference between the two.  Thinking comes from the head while knowing comes from our spiritual heart center which is where the connection is to our higher natures and all that is.  The brain will not accomplish anything spiritual without being connected through a great deal of practice with our higher-self.</p> <p>Now for the good part, since the vibration rate of the Earth has been rising for the past twenty years new tools have become available to us especially now that we’ve passed the 2012 Shift.  The energy of Aurora Source Radiance is one which I was introduced to just days before 10-10-2010.  Having worked with this energy daily it became clear immediately the energy is about rapid spiritual growth.  There’s nothing “instant” about learning anything beyond “not grabbing a hot dish from the oven with our bare hands.”  Everything else takes time allowing it to become part of our understanding.  Aurora Source Radiance isn’t instant learning either although it is learning in the “express lane” cutting so many years off the traditional way we learned spirituality in past centuries.  Now is the time for those feeling the call to move forward and learn.</p> <p>One focus of this spiritual learning teaches us self-empowerment and a greater understanding especially of ourselves.  We share this energy with those having a desire to experience it and for those wishing to experience the healing benefits this energy teaches us.  Those being sensitive to energy will feel how different this energy is.</p> <p>$10.00 is

have understood self-empowerment to mean “I’m going to do it myself.”  In a 3D way this is correct but only from a smaller concept of “self.”  The larger perspective of “self” is greater than a 3D view could be.  When we look in the mirror we see our self.  This self (for most of us with 3D vision) is only a smaller self, a distilled down version of our greater-self and purposefully missing a larger amount of us.  Our 3D self (and/or Ego) seems to have a view “this is it, all that we are is in the mirror.”  This is where some could misunderstand “self-empowerment.”</p> <p>Self-empowerment is learning to accomplish the physical and spiritual things we want to do on our own although we include and incorporate the greater-self back into what we see in the mirror.  This is self-empowerment, working with ALL of us learning to be an active part of our own team again instead of being separate trying to play a team sport on our own.  By the way this is a foundation of Mastery.</p> <p>The energy of Aurora Source teaches us to understand more than we knew.  When we have greater comprehension we see other possibilities which were hidden.  Those feeling ready to step forward have a great availability to learn higher spiritual lessons directly from Divine Sources.  The learning is easier than could be believed without books, lectures or notes to take as those cannot convey the multidimensional information we receive directly from the higher realms.  In other words three dimensional teaching will not teach multidimensional lessons, this has been misunderstood for centuries.</p> <p>We learn to work “with” our Divine Consciousness to accomplish more as we grow spiritually.  As we develop a relationship with the Divine energy of Aurora Source we’re empowered to achieve greater healing through our own expanded understanding of how to manipulate energy for greater health and a better life.  Since we and everything else us is made of energy the only limits are what we understand and will allow ourselves to do.</p> <p>Aurora Source is an Energy of Transformation, the path of a Master is to use our own Divine power within us to make any changes desired in life.</p> <p>We share healing sessions for the better health of ourselves and others as we deepen our understanding of this energy, come and experience the energy to see if your

Told by a roving cast of an anachronistic acting troupe, the musical first wowed audiences in 1972, seducing them with an astonishing musical fable set to a rousing 1970's rock score, including the hits 'Magic to Do' and 'I Guess I'll Miss the Man.'</p> <p>With elements of surrealism and naughtiness, there is a moving core to this quest for fulfilment, told through a medieval fable that still connects with contemporary audiences. Revived on Broadway by director Diane Paulus (Porgy and Bess and Hair) this new incarnation of Pippin won four 2013 Tonys, and is now hitting the road for a bombastic and vivid tour of the USA!</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/0/f/a/600_445468922.jpeg\" /></p> <p>ROLL UP, ROLL UP, THE STORY OF PIPPIN</p> <p>A young and dreamy prince named Pippin is unhappy with his lot.

He becomes involved in a war and switches sides to become a revolutionary, whilst leaving a trail of broken hearts all over the land.
